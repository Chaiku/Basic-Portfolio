            <p>Here is some text that tells about me. I am pretty new to coding - very excited about this class. Learning that practice really does make perfect, the more I code the more muscle memory for it I develop.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In my spare time you can usually find me playing drums or some form of musical instrument. I also love to spend time outdoors hiking and play video games with my friends. Some of my favorite hiking spots here in Georgia include: Sweetwater State Park, Red Top Mountain State Park, and Wormsloe Historic Plantation over in Savannah, GA. Some of my favorite games currently are League of Legends and World of Warcraft.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Hoping to learn as much as I can from this course and get going back in the world on a new career track. Web development feels like a means to really do something useful and also a great field in which I can continue learning constantly. I am very excited for what the future may hold and planning to work hard to achieve my goals!</p>
